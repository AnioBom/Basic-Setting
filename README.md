This application "Basic-Setting" is a small set of screen settings.
There are two screens, on one of them we set the color of the other screen.
At first, the screen is set to white, and then it changes depending on our settings.

You can change the color using the slider or enter a value from 0 to 1.

In this application, I practiced the ability to pass values between interface elements.
